Added two stdout outputs:
** Not 100% happy with this output, I'm working on also returning version info for items in (2)

(1) Every ScanInfo (recognised binary and version (with CVEs))

I.E: (file => ./scaninfo.json)
```
{
    "scan_info": [
        [
            [
                "openssl",
                "openssl",
                "1.0.2a"
            ],
            "/Applications/1Password 7.app/Contents/Frameworks/OnePasswordCore.framework/Versions/A/OnePasswordCore"
        ],
        [
            [
                "openssl",
                "openssl",
                "1.0.2a"
            ],
            "/Applications/1Password 7.app/Contents/Frameworks/B5.framework/Versions/A/B5"
        ]
    ]
}
```

(2) Every binary that was found (currently console only)

I.E:

```
