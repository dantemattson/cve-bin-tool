Added two stdout outputs:
** Not happy with this output, I'm working on also returning version info for items in (2)

(1) Every ScanInfo (recognised binary and version (with CVEs))

I.E:
`[ScanInfo(product_info=ProductInfo(vendor='openssl', product='openssl', version='1.0.2a'), file_path='/Applications/1Password 7.app/Contents/Frameworks/OnePasswordCore.framework/Versions/A/OnePasswordCore'), ScanInfo(product_info=ProductInfo(vendor='openssl', product='openssl', version='1.0.2a'), file_path='/Applications/1Password 7.app/Contents/Frameworks/OnePasswordCore.framework/Versions/A/OnePasswordCore'), ScanInfo(product_info=ProductInfo(vendor='openssl', product='openssl', version='1.0.2a'), file_path='/Applications/1Password 7.app/Contents/Frameworks/B5.framework/Versions/A/B5'), ScanInfo(product_info=ProductInfo(vendor='openssl', product='openssl', version='1.0.2a'), file_path='/Applications/1Password 7.app/Contents/Frameworks/B5.framework/Versions/A/B5')]`

(2) Every binary that was found

I.E:

```
